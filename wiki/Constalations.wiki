#labels weapons,stars,constalations
Constalation creation is one of the features for Suyo-Suyo Supernova. In SSS, a constalation (created by the player) serves as a Suyo's weapon in-game. In order to create a constalation, the player must find an "Elder Squidling" and speak to him.

The player will then have to choose a weapon type...

...And then be taken to a creation screen. Players can color code their stars to determine different effects for their constalations. (i.e, a red star denotes a handle, while a yellow star does nothing)

After a player is done creating his/her weapon, he/she can then name it.
