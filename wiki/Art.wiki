I can update on here, right? Anyway, I will go ahead and post anything that I finished on the downloads page and report that I did it here. (As a means of feedback)

<b>Feb. 10th, 2011:</b> My computer is still in the repair shop, and will be picked up soon. As soon as that happens, I can go ahead and create a few more models. (I had this awesome idea about a giant space-turtle...But thats for a later update)

Thankfully, my library has a copy of Adobe Photoshop on some of the computers, which I used in order to make the skybox.

There are 2 versions of the skybox (named "SkyBox" and "SkyBox21") and 6 pictures for each one. (Top, bottom, north, south, east, and west)
 
"Skybox" is the original image that has had nothing done to it.

"Skybox21" has had its colors messed around with.

I can't decide which ones to use for the game, so will let you guys decide.

I'll go ahead and post the skybox on the downloads page. Other than this, I got little done other than some concept art and the beginning of the giant space turtle island.
