Welcome to Suyo-Suyo Supernova 


Suyo-Suyo Supernova is a mmorpg game managed by Adr, Katch (Kijiriko), and powerpup118.

In the game, you play as a "Suyo". 

What is a Suyo?

A Suyo is a short, chubby race that saw the wonders of the Galaxies. They sought to protect these wonders from the corrupted Squidlings that swallow up everything they see, blackening the Galaxies of light as a result.

You can choose the color of the Suyo's clothes, and collect garments (jewels, bells, etc) for his little hat to become more stronger. The NPCs are these things called "Squidlings".

Squidlings are composed of the unfathomable essence that makes up the universe and all of it's wonders. When Galaxies die, their suns explode and give off a fantastic energy that gives birth to other squidlings.

Good squidlings grow up to become new Galaxies, where Evil Squidlings  will eventually succumb to a voracious hunger and grow up to become Red Giants or Black Holes. Some squidlings are neutral, and will eventually fade away into nothingness when their lifespan ends.
