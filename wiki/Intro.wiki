Welcome to Suyo-Suyo Supernova 


Suyo-Suyo Supernova is a mmorpg game managed by Adr, Katch, and powerpup118.

In the game, you play as a "Suyo", which is this little guy right here. You can choose the color of the suyos clothes, and collect garments (jewels, bells, etc) for his little hat to become more stronger. The NPCs are these things called "Squidlings" Good squidlings grow up to turn into Galaxies, which Evil Squidlings grow up to become Red Giants or Black Holes.

What is a Suyo?

A Suyo is a short-chubby race that saw the wonders in the Galaxies. They sought to protect these wonders from the corrupted Squidlings that were destroying anything the saw fight to blacken the Galaxies of light.
